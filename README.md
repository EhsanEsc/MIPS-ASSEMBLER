# MIPS-ASSEMBLER

This Assembler converts MIPS instructions to binary format. It can be used in computer architucture projects.
Script used instruction signatures from https://opencores.org/projects/plasma/opcodes. 
You can add new instruction signature to MIPSInstructions.txt according to format.

Script takes one argument for address of instructions file. Then prints binary code of each instruction and saves them in mips_inst.data 
There are two examples in example folder.

It is implemented by python. Code is very very dirty becuase of tight deadline.

# TODO
1. Clean Python Code
2. Add new implementation by Go and Haskal languages.
3. Add more description to README.
